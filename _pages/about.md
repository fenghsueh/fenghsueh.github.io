I am currently a research associate / doctoral student at [amtc Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center at Tongji University](https://mefaculty.tongji.edu.cn/) enrolled by the Bachelor-to-Doctorate Program, working with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Weimin Zhang](https://mefaculty.tongji.edu.cn/info/1296/3238.htm). During this, from 2021 to 2022, I had a hybrid internship at Delta Electronics as an Academia-Industry Joint Project Manager / Process Optimization Engineer. From 2023 to 2024, I was a guest researcher at the [wbk Institute of Production Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/english/index.php), under the guidance of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jürgen Fleischer](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/english/21_211.php). I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Shanghai Maritime University in 2019.

My research interests lie in diagnostic knowledge transfer and agile predictive maintenance for machine components using transfer learning. My current work mainly focuses on open-set domain adaptation, deep learning, and cost-performance-balanced optimization in production. I have published papers in journals such as Measurement, Advances in Manufacturing, and so on. I was also awarded the Best Paper Award on CMAAE 2021.

I am looking for a postdoctoral position and open for collaboration. If you would like to reach me out, please feel free to contact me via E-mail or social media.
